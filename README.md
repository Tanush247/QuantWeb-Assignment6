This assignment requires you to develop a Django website consisting of a main project and multiple attached apps.

## Commands

### Creating a Project

```bash
django-admin startproject name_of_your_project
```

### Creating an App

Replace `name_of_your_app` with your desired app name:
```bash
python manage.py startapp name_of_your_app
```

### Starting the Server

To view your project on localhost:
```bash
python manage.py runserver

## Instructions

2. Set up your environment:

   a) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv virtual
   .\virtual\Scripts\activate
   ```

   Install Django:
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

   b) Alternatively, install Django directly:
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd QuantWeb-Assignment6
   ```

4. Creating and Pushing the Project:

   Any team member can create the project and push it to the repo:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Main project initialized"
   git push
   ```

   This pushes your files to the Git repo. Use `git pull` to sync with changes made by others.

### Building Apps

Create at least 2 fully configured apps using `urls.py` and `views.py`. Commit these to your repos.

### Notes

- The app creator should commit their files.
- You will be assessed based on your commits.
- Resolve conflicts with `git pull`, then `git add .`, `git commit -m "Your Message"`, and `git push`.

**Deadline:** 16th June EOD.
